# vmake inspect

`vmake inspect` prints the resolved project model as one JSON document
(schemaVersion 1) on stdout. It runs dependency resolution, `OnConfig`, and
dry-run `OnBuild` target declaration only: it never compiles, links, installs,
or writes `build/`, `install/`, or `.vmake/config.json`.

```
vmake inspect [--set [package/]option=value ...]
```

Buildscript stdout is discarded while the model is resolved, so stdout always
contains exactly one JSON document even when `build.go` prints. On success
stderr is empty except for one `Warning: ...` line per target-declaration
warning; on failure it carries one `Error: ...` line.

## Envelope

Success:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "command": "inspect",
  "status": "ok",
  "data": { "...": "..." },
  "diagnostics": []
}
```

Failure (no `data`, exit 1):

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "command": "inspect",
  "status": "error",
  "diagnostics": [
    {
      "severity": "error",
      "code": "VMAKE_E_OPTION",
      "message": "proj/flag: invalid bool value: \"maybe\" (use true/false, on/off, or 1/0)"
    }
  ]
}
```

`diagnostics` is always an array. Error codes:

- `VMAKE_E_INSPECT` — the model could not be produced (load, `Require`,
  `Configure`, or inspection failure).
- `VMAKE_E_OPTION` — invalid `--set` key, unknown package/option, wrong value
  type, or an invalid choice.
- `VMAKE_W_TARGET_DECLARE` — warning: one package's `OnBuild` failed while
  targets were declared. Its `targets` are omitted, `status` stays `"ok"`, exit
  is 0, and a `fix` field is present.

## `data` fields

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `root` | Absolute project root (the directory containing `.vmake/`) |
| `configFile`, `configSha256` | Active config file name and SHA-256; hash of empty content when absent |
| `mode`, `toolchain` | Effective build mode and project toolchain name |
| `toolchainInfo` | `{name, targetOs?, targetTriple?, installPath?, cc?, cxx?, ar?, ld?}` |
| `global` | Effective global option values, including `mode` and `toolchain` |
| `overrides` | Typed `--set` values keyed `[package/]option`; omitted when unused |
| `roots` | Needed local packages that no resolved package depends on, sorted |
| `packages` | Resolved package entries, sorted by name |
| `graph` | Package dependency edges `{from, to}`, sorted |
| `compileDatabase` | `<root>/build/compile_commands.json` (expected path, even before a build) |
| `buildReport` | `<root>/build/vmake-build.json` (last build result) |

Each `packages` entry has `name`, `kind` (`local`/`native`/`registry`),
`needed`, `deps`, optional remote `repo`/`version`/`commit`/`url`, local `path`
and absolute `sourceDir`, `description`, `toolchain`, `options` (effective
values), and `targets` (needed packages that declare targets).

Each `targets` entry has `name`, `kind` (`binary`/`static`/`shared`/`object`/
`void`), `default`, `test`, declared `files`/`excludedFiles`/`includes`/
`publicIncludes`/`defines`/`languages`/`links`/`deps`/`postLinkOutputs`,
`output` (artifact name; empty for `void`), `installDir`, and `noInstall`.
`files` keeps the declared globs; inspect does not expand them into source
lists.

## `--set` overrides

`--set` is repeatable and evaluates a hypothetical configuration for this run
only; nothing is persisted. Unknown packages/options, wrong types, and invalid
choices exit 1 with `VMAKE_E_OPTION`.

The value is coerced with the option's declared type, matching
`vmake config --set`:

- bool: `true`/`false`, `on`/`off`, `1`/`0` (case-insensitive)
- int: numeric text with an integral value (`42`, `42.0`, `1e3`); `quick` and
  `1.5` are rejected
- string: raw text, so `42`, `true`, and `on` remain strings
- choice: raw text validated against the declared choices

Typed coercion needs the declarations, so `--set` resolves twice: once without
overrides to learn the option types, then a fresh context applies the typed
values before `Configure`. This roughly doubles resolution time and repeats
`OnConfig`/`OnApply` side effects; plain `inspect` stays single-pass. If an
option is only declared after an override changes dependency selection, its raw
text is stored and post-`Configure` validation reports any type mismatch.

Examples:

```sh
vmake inspect
vmake inspect --set mode=release --set proj/retries=5
vmake inspect --set proj/label=42          # string option keeps "42"
vmake inspect --set proj/with_dep=on       # bool alias becomes true
vmake inspect --set dep/dep_mode=slow      # choice validated
```

## Exit status and determinism

Exit 0 means a model was produced (including models with target-declaration
warnings); exit 1 means it was not. Output is deterministic for the same
project, configuration, and overrides: consecutive runs are byte-identical.

The long-form schema lives in `docs/INSPECT.md` in the vmake source checkout.
